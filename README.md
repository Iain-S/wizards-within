# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

![A wizard shooting lightning](wizard-gif-5.gif)

The full book is available online from MIT Press for free [here](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html), though I prefer the formatting and footnotes of [this](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/) version.

## Setup

There are other ways to work through SICP, like using Emacs or repl.it but I have found DrRacket to work best for me.

1. Install [DrRacket](https://download.racket-lang.org), the Racket language IDE.
1. The DrRacket SICP [support package](https://github.com/sicp-lang/sicp) may be required.
1. Use `#lang sicp` at the top of any new .rkt file.

## Notes

1. One file per chapter, or sub-chapter, seems to be a good compromise: if you try to fit more than that you get too many naming conflicts.
